# Image Captioning 

This project implements an image captioning system using a deep learning model that leverages an attention mechanism. The repository contains code for data preprocessing, model building, training (including a fine-tuning phase), and deployment via a Gradio interface.

> **Note:** Due to time constraints, the model is not fine-tuned properly. Further training and hyperparameter optimization are recommended for improved performance.

## Project Setup and Running Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muzifa-mubarak/Image-Captioning-with-Attention.git
   cd Image-Captioning-with-Attention
```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the necessary libraries:
```bash
     pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tqdm gradio
```
3. **Repository Files:**
   - **image-caption.ipynb:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full pipeline.
   - **image_captioning_model.h5:** Pre-trained model weights.
   - **tokenizer.pkl:** Tokenizer for caption processing.

4. **Running the Notebook:**
   - Open **image-caption.ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to:
       * Download and preprocess the Flickr8k dataset.
       * Extract image features using a pre-trained ResNet50.
       * Build and train the image captioning model with an attention mechanism.
       * Fine-tune the model (note the fine-tuning was limited due to time constraints).
       * Deploy a Gradio interface for testing.
5. **Deploying the Gradio Interface:**
   - At the end of the notebook, a Gradio interface is launched.

## Overview of the Model, API, and Frontend
- **Overview of the Model, API, and Frontend**
    - **ResNet50:** Used to extract high-level image features.
    - **GloVe Embeddings:** Convert textual data (captions) into numerical vectors.
    - **LSTM Layers with Attention:** Generate captions by processing sequential data and dynamically focusing on important image features.
- **API:**
    - he model is exposed through a Gradio interface that acts as an API. Users can upload an image, and the system returns a generated caption.
- **Frontend:**
    - The Gradio interface serves as a lightweight frontend. It provides an interactive way to test the model by uploading images and displaying generated captions in real time.

## Thought Process, Model Selection, and Design Considerations
- **Thought Process:**
    - The goal was to develop an end-to-end system for image captioning that demonstrates the capabilities of combining computer vision with natural language processing. Emphasis was placed on modular design to separate data handling, model building, and deployment.
- **Model Selection:**
    - **ResNet50** was chosen for its proven performance in image recognition tasks.
    - **LSTM Networks** effectively capture sequential patterns in text.
    - Incorporating an **Attention Mechanism** allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of an image when generating captions.
- **Design Considerations:**
    - **Modularity:** The code is divided into clear sections (data preprocessing, model training, inference, and deployment).
    - **Scalability:** The Gradio interface makes it easy to deploy and test the model in various environments.
    - **Performance vs. Complexity:** Due to limited fine-tuning, the current model represents a balance between complexity and training time, with room for further optimization.

## Areas for Improvement and Potential Extensions
- **Model Fine-Tuning:**
<ul>The current model has not been fine-tuned extensively. Additional training, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring alternative architectures (e.g., transformer-based models) could improve caption quality.</ul>

- **Dataset Expansion:**
<ul>Using larger and more diverse datasets (like MS COCO) could help build a more robust captioning system.</ul>

- **Advanced Attention Mechanisms:**
<ul>Experimenting with state-of-the-art attention methods, such as self-attention or transformer layers, may further enhance the model's performance.</ul>

- **Custom Web Application:**
<ul>While Gradio provides a simple interface, integrating the model into a custom web application could offer a richer user experience and more functionality.</ul>

- **Real-Time Inference Optimization:**
<ul>Optimizing the model for faster inference on different platforms (e.g., mobile devices) would extend its usability in real-world applications.</ul>
